# Weather-App
Weather App made using Rapid API and my own places-API

### Note: Backend for the website is in development

## Overview

- Weather App is an online tool with which you can check out the weather of any city in the world. 
- Weather API by [API-Ninjas](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/weather-by-api-ninjas/) from Rapid API is used for fetching weather info.
- Used my own open-sourced [places-API](https://github.com/pooranjoyb/places-API) to fetch data for auto-complete search
- [Jqwery Autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) is used that enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering
